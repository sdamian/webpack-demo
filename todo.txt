* Angular JS the old fashion way
    * template syntax (two way binding by default)
    * modules (dependencies - https://github.com/cgross/angular-busy)
    * controllers ("controller as" syntax vs $scope vs components)
    * services (factories, providers)
    * directives
    * dependency injection (MyController.$inject = [])
    * components ()
* Angular JS with components
* Advanced stuff
    * directives?
    * digest cycle
